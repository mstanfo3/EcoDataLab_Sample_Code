# EcoDataLab_Sample_Code

Thank you for considering my work! I have provided a sample code from my research with the NASA GSFC Climate and Radiation Laboratory.

In this file, I load electron density data (binned 5°x30° [magnetic latitude x magnetic longitude]) along with daily averaged index information from OMNIWeb. I then deseasonalize the data to account for solar trends as I am regressing over a multiyear (2021-2024) period.
Afterwards, I visualize the strength of the linear relationship between a chosen geomagnetic index (in this case, Kp-Index) and the electron density in the lower ionosphere.
My plots focus on the Northern and Southern Auroral Oval (shown side by side) as these magnetic latitude bands demonstrated the greatest correlation coefficient.

Please let me know if you have any questions :)
